description: A simple reminder of how awesome raw React can be for your every day applications

I've been writing React for about a year and a half or so now and I realize I've got a lot to learn in comparison to some of my peers, so consume this post with that in mind. However, React has been the core of my development process and focus for nearly the entirety of my professional career as a developer and I have learned more about its mechanics in that time than I have any other technology. All that being said, I'd like to share my thoughts on managing React state and why, in most scenarios, you won't need Redux, and in even the more obscure ones, you also don't need Context. I certainly don't consider myself a puritan in my daily life, but with React, I've been leaning more and more towards such a life style (and feeling like an old man as I do it!).
